# Nymph


Welcome to Nymph! A lightweight, beginner friendly web template. Using Typescript, Sass, Webpack and Babel.


Here are some tips to get you started:

- Download [node] (https://nodejs.org/en/) and install it.
- Download the repo and cd into the root directory that contains the package.json file.
- Run npm install to download all the dependancies. You can also inspect the package.json file to see which dependancies will be downloaded.
- That's all! Now you should just ba able to type 'npm run' in your terminal to start up the development server.
- When you want to deploy your site, you only need to upload the public directory.
- All your Javascript code goes into 'src/scripts'. Feel free to create as many .ts files as you desire! Just import them into 'index.ts' using the import/export schema.
- All your CSS goes into 'src/theme'. You can add as many scss files as you desire. To use new .scss files, just import them using the existing import schema used in main.scss. It's also important that you remember to add an underscore('_') to the front of your new files so that they don't get compiled into an extra file by the Sass compiler. Remember to refer to your resources as relevant to 'public/stylesheets/resources' when you use media in your css rules. 
- All your HTML markup goes into 'public/**.html'. These files work as regular html files.
